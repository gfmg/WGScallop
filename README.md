# WGScallop :ocean:
The ICES Scallop Assessment working group (WGScallop) discusses the key issues surrounding
scallop species and is working towards the development and improvement of appropriate stock
assessment methods. The WG shares expertise on survey methodologies, advances in technology and recent studies on scallop species. Latest available report can be downloaded from: https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Forms/DispForm.aspx?ID=37267

This github repository serves as the platform where members of the group collaboratively contribute to deliver the objectives in WGScallop. It is organized in different folders containing the work carried in the WGScallop Sub-groups. 

## Irish Sea SubGroup (ToR C)
The folder `IoM_SurveyData`contains the exploration (`1_IOM_Data_Exploration.R`) and analysis carried to develop standardized indices of abundance from the Isle of Man using the Vector Autoregressive Spatiotemporal Component (VAST) (https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST). The script `1_IoM_VAST_grid.R`first produces a grid for the extrapolation of VAST outputs over the study area, while the script `1_IoM_Post2009.R` implements several model formulations.

None of the data is available on the github repo.
